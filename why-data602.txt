Why Data602?

I am excited to take DATA602 because I want to improve my ability to analyze, interpret, and communicate insights from data. I see this course as an opportunity to build confidence in working with data and to prepare myself for tackling more complex problems in future classes and professional work. I want to find my niche in the tech world such as MLOps which leverages my prior experience with my passion for data science.
